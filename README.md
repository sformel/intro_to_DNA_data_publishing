### credits/acknowledgements need to be added

> make sure to credit those who have helped in the lesson’s development or inspired it, and/or any resources/templates that you have reused. You can also link to a separate AUTHORS.md file within the repository’s root directory to list all the people who contributed to the lesson content (if this list starts to become too large to include in the README itself)

### citation TBD:

> a convention is to include the citation information for your lesson in a separate CITATION file within the repository’s root directory and link to it from README.md so others can cite the use of the lesson in their own publications and media and it can also be automatically discovered by other applications. These CITATION files are discussed in more detail below.
license - a short description of and a link to the lesson’s license typically contained in a separate LICENSE, LICENSE.txt or LICENSE.md file within the repository’s root directory. The lesson repository created from the Carpentries lesson template already contains a default LICENSE.md file, but you should modify this to more accurately describe how the lesson content can be re-used by others.
