### Create a GBIF Account

Got to <https://www.gbif.org/>. In the upper-right corner, click `Login`. Click on the `Register` tab of the box that opens. Feel free to create a new username and password, or authenticate with your Google, or GitHub accounts.

### Create a Test IPT Account

A demo installation of the latest IPT version is hosted by GBIF at <https://ipt.gbif.org/>. If you don't have an account yet, please ask the GBIF helpdesk (helpdesk@gbif.org) to create one for you.

### Create a Test MDT Account

For testing and training purposes, GBIF maintains the MDT Sandbox (a demo installation): <https://mdt.gbif-test.org> You should be able to login with the same GBIF account you created above.

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop
