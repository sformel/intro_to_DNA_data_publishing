## General Information

The GBIF-NA DNA Publishing Workshop is designed for researchers and collection managers looking to publish DNA-derived data using established biodiversity data standards. This workshop will introduce key data standards, tools, and workflows for sharing environmental and specimen-derived DNA data through the biodiversity data aggregator GBIF.

Participants will gain hands-on experience with data mapping in IPT, learn how to enable DNA extensions, and explore the GBIF Metabarcoding Data Toolkit (MDT). This is not a beginner’s workshop—attendees should have their own data and a basic understanding of biodiversity informatics.

For background on best practices in publishing DNA data, we recommend reading "Publishing DNA-derived data through biodiversity data platforms".

**Who:**
This workshop is designed for collection managers and researchers who are already familiar with DNA science but need guidance on publishing DNA-derived data using community standards. Participants should be aware of the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) and have their own dataset to work with, though a standard dataset will also be provided for examples. This is not a beginner’s workshop—attendees should have a working knowledge of DNA barcoding, environmental DNA (eDNA), or related molecular techniques but may be unfamiliar with data standards such as MIxS, DwC, and MDT.

**Where:**
This training will take place online. The instructors will provide you with the information you will need to connect to this meeting.

**When:**
Friday May 9, 2025; 10:00am - 4:00pm CST Add to your Google Calendar.

**Requirements:**
Participants must have access to a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed below).
